# WellConnected

The goal of the project, WellConnected, is to create a way for current Wellesley students to access information on what recent alums did in their first few years out of college. The motivation for the project came from seeing a couple of departments gathering information on their own from seniors about their plans after graduation, whether it be a job or graduate school. Seniors are then added to a departmental email list that will be sent out to students at the beginning of the year. The email list, however, is long and not easily searchable or sortable. Therefore, the hope is to create something that is not only easily searchable and sortable but also not limited to students and seniors in a single department. Since the application is made to serve Wellesley students, a Wellesley email address (@wellesley.edu) is required to sign up for an account. The program allows users to create an account, search the database, and update existing profiles.

The project is up and running [here](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~hhau/WellConnected/home.php).

Instructions to get started on using the program:

1. If username and password requested by http://cs.wellesley.edu:
  *	Username: guest
  * Password: sesam9e

2. Sample username and password to log in (on the homepage of the web application):
  * Username: username@wellesley.edu
  * Password: 1234
  
The sample username and password is also shown on the login page. You can signup for an account and use that to explore the application, but make sure to use an email address that ends with (@wellesley.edu). Don't worry, you can make up a username and add @wellesley.edu after it for now. The person who might actually have the email will not be contacted. Example search inputs are shown next to the search boxes. Multiple criteria per search is allowed. For example, you can search "math" and "2016" at the same time and get a list of math majors or minors in the class of 2016.
